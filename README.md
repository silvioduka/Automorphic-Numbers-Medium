Automorphic Numbers - Medium -from Coding Challenges by Silvio Duka

If the square of a number ends with the number itself, it is considered to be automorphic. 

For Example: 

25 is an automorphic number, as the square of 25 = 625 (ends with 25). 

Sequence of automorphic numbers: 1, 5, 6, 25, 76, 376, .. 

Tasks: 

(Easy) Write a program to verify whether a given number is automorphic or not. 

(Medium) Write a program to find all the automorphic numbers in a range.
